Disclaimer: The findings presented in this report are based on the available data, which may
have limitations and uncertainties. The unusual covariance structure between Depression and
Anxiety scores suggests that the data may not be entirely reliable. Therefore, the conclusions
drawn from this analysis should be considered preliminary and subject to further investigation.
Data Collection:
The group chose the topic of sleep and how different factors such as mental health
affect students' sleep. We obtained our data from a case study that conducted a comprehensive
analysis of stress factors affecting students through a machine learning approach. This case
study can be found in the data availability section of the article.

Challenges:
The biggest challenge our group faced was data collection. We originally found data on
Kaggle but after a closer evaluation of its reliability, we found that the data was artificial. As a
result, we had to find different data which led us to this study. The data had multiple columns
such as depression, sleep quality, academic performance, etc as quantitative data on different
scales. The report offered no explanation of how these different columns were scaled so the
team had to go one by one to figure out what scale each column had. We also had challenges
ensuring that the “Stress Level Dataset” was reliable, while completing our analyses, we found
the data seemed a bit fishy, but due to time constraints, we were instructed to continue with this
dataset.
Sleep-Deprived Dreams
The hallmark of modern education is the relentless pursuit of academic and extracurricular
excellence. But these aspirations come with a big cost which is losing sleep quality. We explore
the complex relationship between sleep, mental health, academic performance, and how sleep
deprivation affects student well-being.
Based on the data we collected from a recent study; we found a clear negative correlation
between the number of extracurricular activities and sleep quality. Students who participated in
multiple activities were more likely to report insufficient sleep and poorer sleep quality. As a
result of sleep deprivation, an array of negative consequences is triggered, including an
increase in anxiety and depression, which eventually destroys their self-esteem and negatively
impacts their academic performance in the long run.
Despite having multiple extracurricular commitments, students often find themselves sleepdeprived,
with an average sleep duration of less than 8 hours. Chronic sleep deprivation
disrupts hormone and neurotransmitter balance, resulting in cognitive and emotional
dysfunctions.
The lack of sleep is a strong risk factor for mental health disorders. As sleep-deprived students
struggle to cope with their packed schedules, their anxiety levels soar. Sleep disturbances can
worsen depression in students, leaving them feeling overwhelmed and hopeless as they
become increasingly irritable and have difficulty concentrating on academics.
Based on the data collected we also noticed that sleep deprivation correlates with how students
view themselves. When students don't keep up, they lose their self-esteem. They may feel
inadequate, unworthy, and always lagging. This erosion of self-esteem can intensify anxiety and
depression.
Academic performance is the ultimate casualty of sleep deprivation. Chronic sleep deprivation
causes students to struggle to pay attention in class, retain information, and solve problems.
Grades suffer, and motivation wanes. It is possible for the bright student who excelled in
academics to struggle to keep up with the class.
Creating a more balanced and sustainable approach to education is essential. Schools, parents,
and students themselves need to work together to prioritize sleep as a fundamental component
of student well-being. The cycle of sleep deprivation and its consequences can be broken if we
encourage students to set realistic goals, manage their time effectively, and prioritize sleep.
Students should not sacrifice their mental health or academic performance to achieve academic
and extracurricular excellence. To empower students to thrive in and out of the classroom, we
must acknowledge the importance of sleep and take steps to prioritize it. Together, we can
ensure that our students are well-rested, mentally healthy, and academically successful.
